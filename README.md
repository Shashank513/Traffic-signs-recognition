# Traffic-signs-recognition

This project aims to enhance road safety by leveraging machine learning for the automated recognition and classification of traffic signs in images. The core of the project involves the use of a meticulously curated dataset containing labeled images of various traffic signs. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and validating a machine learning model.In the initial stages, image preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance the quality of the input data. This includes operations such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to ensure the model's robustness to different conditions. The model architecture, often based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is designed to effectively extract features from the input images and discriminate between different types of traffic signs.The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters using the labeled dataset. Subsequently, the model undergoes validation on a separate dataset to assess its performance and generalization capabilities. Rigorous testing on new, unseen traffic sign images follows, simulating real-world scenarios to gauge the model's practical utility.The project provides detailed insights into the model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.
